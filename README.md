# varaapoyta
Table reserving site that uses reversed Raflaamo endpoints

Writing this on (21.12.2022), I finished the refactor of the backend (https://github.com/52617365/Varaapoyta-refactor), but as of today, requests to the graph API (https://s-varaukset.fi/api/recommendations/slot/38/2022-12-22/0800/1) stopped working. I think Raflaamo stopped showing those scuffed graphs on their restaurant pages therefore dropping support for the API.

A picture of the scuffed graphs can be seen in my blog post. https://www.rasmusmaki.com/blog/raflaamo-api
