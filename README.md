# What is varaapoyta?
## Varaapoyta is a free table reserving project that uses a reverse engineered Raflaamo API to make reserving of a restaurant table faster, easier and seamless.

# Motivation
## In my opinion, reserving a table from the Raflaamo.fi site should be easier and faster. Making it easy and seamless for the user is the engineers job. They recently updated the site and they didn't make it any easier functionality wise so I decided to step in.
